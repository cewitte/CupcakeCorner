# CupcakeCorner

## Project 10

A multi-screen app for ordering cupcakes. This will use a couple of forms, but it also shows how to send and receive the order data from the internet, how to validate forms, and more.

As we continue to dig deeper and deeper into `Codable`, we'll see how flexible and safe it is. In particular, it is very different it is from the much older `UserDefaults` API – it’s so nice not having to worry about typing strings exactly correctly!
